The purpose of this project is to create a pan-tilt device, which position is to be regulated. A model of the pan-tilt system will be developed and a regulation system will be created for it. The device is moved by two dc motors, which are controlled by a FPGA, which also tracks speed and position. The FPGA is a Spartan3E, on a Xilinx Nexys 2, which will be programmed in VHDL. The system is regulated by an ARM microprocessor and the ARM is also taking care of the user interface. The ARM is a Stellaris LM3S6965 on an Evaluation Board programmed in C and a FreeRTOS OS is running on the system. The two units are communicating by a SPI connection. The team decided to divide the project into small independent modules. This will result in a high cohesion which will make modifications much easier to implement and earlier developed modules can be reused in the development, debugging and testing of other modules.
