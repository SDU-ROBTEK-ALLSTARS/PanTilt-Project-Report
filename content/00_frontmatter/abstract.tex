The purpose of this project was to create an embedded solution for controlling a pan/tilt system. This is due to the wish of increasing the students technical knowledge of operating systems, control systems and digital design through VHDL.

A mathematical model of the system was derived, and a control system was created from analysing the model. The FPGA was programmed in VHDL to implement a PWM generator, and counters for position of the system. The LM3S6965 microprocessor runs FreeRTOS as operating system and the embedded software was written in C. The microprocessor also runs the control system.

An embedded control system is developed with success. The system was very robust and the control system acts fast and precise. Furthermore a system had been developed and tested such that it is possible to expand the functionality of the system without replacing existing components in it.

The significance of creating a system that actually works, has given the participating students a great insight in the problems that are related to this kind of assignment.
