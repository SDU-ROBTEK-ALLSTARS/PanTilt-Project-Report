\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

%overall
A working system was created for the pan/tilt. 
%dynamics
A mathematical model was developed and analysed, it is concluded that using a state-space model for simulating the system is excessive, and a simple transfer function was used instead.
%control
A PID control model was made, that could accurately control the system.
%llc communication
A working motor interface was made for the FPGA and it was possible to control the system through an SPI link.

%ARM
%The control system was successfully implemented on the microprocessor together with the operating system handling all the different tasks. 

The operating system on the microprocessor could easily run the different tasks, including the control task, and still have more than half of its execution time available.


%FINAL SOLUTI--CONCLUSION!!!
Even though some parts were downgraded to meet the deadline, the system works and is very precise.
