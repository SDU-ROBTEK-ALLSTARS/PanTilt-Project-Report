\section{Requirements}
This project has in many ways an experimental approach, where it is highly up to the students to figure out how to solve the assignment. This is due to the requirement of building a protocol stack which uses DTMF tones as data carriers. The exact requirements of the assignment are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Computers must communicate by exchanging DTMF tones in air.
\item A protocol stack must be build, layered architecture.
\item Information must be exchanged between computers.
\item A distributed application must be developed in C++.
\item It is required that the application performs some meaningful task.
\end{itemize}
