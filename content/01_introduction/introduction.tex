\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

This project is devised as a part of the B.Sc. Robot Systems Engineering, 4th term course at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark, Odense spring 2012. The implicit goal is to obtain basic knowledge of embedded systems. This is because that embedded systems figure as a significant part of robots as these systems often control actuators and process sensor inputs for controlling the robot. Therefore it is also demanded for students participating in this course to grasp the basic concepts of classic and modern control theory. Coupling control theory and embedded systems demand for the student to understand the basics of real time systems, digital systems, embedded systems and control systems. Applying this knowledge in the real world will be as significant as grasping the concepts.

Because the DSMI\footnote{The Engineering Education Model of the University of Southern Denmark} model is used as a framework for this particular education, it is required for the students participating in this course to formulate a strategy for solving an assignment in teams.
