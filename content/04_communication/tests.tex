\section{Reliability of the implemented FPGA SPI Hardware}
\label{sec:spi_rel_test}
This experiment has the purpose of testing how reliable the implemented SPI hardware and protocol is. 

\subsection{Range}	% (Which system part is tested?)
The SPI interface will be tested as a stand alone unit-test, so no other hardware has access to read or write the shared memory as this could effect the test results. The test is done by generating 32 random bytes, writing these to the memory on the FPGA. Afterwards the 32 bytes are read from the FPGA and compared with the bytes send. To test the performance in noisy environments, different cables length are used. It is a goal to find out how long distance data can be transferred without errors starting to occur.

%The position will shift between two different positions and the positions will be recorded when the controller believes the position is reached. When controller stops the position are marked, and the other position is set to the controller and this position are now marked etc. This is repeated ten times.

\subsection{Test Setup}
The test setup is done by isolating the SPI hardware and memory on the FPGA. An arduino\footnote{http://arduino.cc} is connected as master to the FPGA SPI interface, and by a serial port to a computer. The arduino has been programmed to pass serial data to the SPI hardware and SPI data to the serial port. The SPI will in the test run at a speed of 4MHz. A C\#.net application has been written to generate random bytes, write them to the memory, read them back, compare and log the results. This allows easy testing of the hardware with different configurations. The test software is considered a black box testing tool in this project. It is not be described in greater details, but it is included on the CD. Figure \ref{fig:spi_testapplication} shows a pircture of the testing software in progress. A big textbox shows the test log, and a small box on the right outputs the CSV data with the test results.

For every cable length in the test, the read/write process is done 100 times to give a good average on the results. The test is started with a long cable, which are then shorted between every test to give an idea about a what length the errors starts to occur.

Nothing will be control the electric noise in the test. But all test will be made in the same environment to make the results comparable.

The test turned out quite unexpected. It was expected that at some length, a small amount of errors would start to occur and then slowly rise while the cable length was increased until no data could be transferred correctly. The test shows that data can be transferred successfully with cables up to 25cm, and then errors starts to occur, but at a length of 75cm the error does not increase dramatic by increasing the length of the cable.

The data from the test were logged, but i will not be analysed in this report, it is though included on the CD for further studies.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The test concludes that data successfully can be sent and received correctly at a speed of 4MHz at distances up to 25cm.
