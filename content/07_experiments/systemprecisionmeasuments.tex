\section{Performance testing}

\subsection{Precision of the system}\label{subsec:precisionofsystem}
This experiment will test the precision of the complete system with the
parameters found from simulating the system. The parameters can be found in
table \ref{tab:actual_gain_values}

\subsection*{Setup}

The test is performed by fastening a laser pointer on the pan/tilt system. A
board is placed next to the system and two positions where the pointer is on the
board are chosen as seen in figure \ref{fig:systemtestsetup}. The laser pointer is placed 180 cm
from the board. Thus each degree is at aproximately 3 centimetres wide.

\[ tan(1 \ deg) * 180 \ cm \approx 3,14 \ cm \]

\end{figure}

The system runs in automode and changes between two setpoints. The positions
are marked and the test ends after ten iterations. 

\subsection*{Results}

At both points the error was less than five centimetres and most of the time
less than two centimetres. This means that the system have an accuracy between 0.658 and
3.293 degrees. This precision is reached with overshoot.

\[ \frac{2,0 \ cm}{3,14\ cm/deg} = 0,64 \ deg \]

\[ \frac{10,0 \ cm}{3,14 \ cm/deg} = 3,19 \ deg \]

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The system itself, has a precision of af third degree.
\[ \frac{360}{160} = 1/3 \]

It is a high precision that have been observed, at times the uncertainty is as
small as the precision of the system. Though it does also show that a higher
precision can be obtained. Overshooting was though occurring in the control.
Additional tuning of the parameters might enhance the performance.

\subsection{Precision of new parameters}\label{sec:precisionofsystem2}

This experiment will test the PID values found in table \ref{tab:actual_gain_values}
under best performance.

Here the system will run in automode between two position but only one of the
positions are marked. This is repeated ten times.

\subsection*{Setup}

The setup is similar to the setup in section \ref{subsec:precisionofsystem}, see
Figure \ref{fig:systemtestsetup}, with the exception that only one point is measured and at
the distance 370 centimetres. Thus each degree is 6,46 centimetres wide.

\[ tan(1 \ deg) * 370 \ cm \approx 6,46 \ cm \]

\subsection*{Results}

In this test the precision of the pan and tilt were recorded to be quite
different. The vertical precision was 7,5 cm, but the horizontal precision was just 2,0 cm. Thus the pan/tilt system have
reached precision of respectively 0.31 degrees and 1.16 degrees.


\[ \frac{2,0}{6,46} = 0.31 \]

\[ \frac{7,5}{6,46} = 1.16 \]

\subsection*{Conclusion}
The pan has reached a constant precision on par with the system precision
of one third of a centimeter. The tilt part have also become more precise, but
it should be possible to make it even more precise. It could be that because the
tilt is affected by gravity it is harder to control than the pan.
